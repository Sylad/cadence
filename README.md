# cadence

A small working method that lives in your repository. Solo developers and
AI-assisted sessions lose track of *what is left to do* and *what each commit
was for*; cadence keeps both in plain files next to the code.

Four tools:

- **raf** (French *reste à faire*, "what is left to do"): the plan, linked to your commits;
- **news**: a user-facing changelog with screenshots, tied to the plan;
- **session**: the facts to start and to close a work session;
- **deliver**: wait for the CI of the pushed commit, deploy, then **verify the effect**.

And four [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skills that turn them
into rituals — `session-start`, `session-close`, `deliver`, and `lead` to pilot
several projects through subagents — plus a `ux-reviewer` agent: no user-facing
change is done before its usability review.

## raf

- The plan is a YAML file in the repo (`docs/plan/raf.yaml`), edited by the CLI.
  Your comments and hand edits are preserved.
- A commit belongs to a lot when its message cites the id: `feat(L3): …`,
  `fix: L3/t1 …`. The link is **computed from `git log`**, never stored, so
  committing never dirties the plan.
- `raf check` audits drift between the plan and the history.
- `raf gantt` writes a single self-contained HTML page (no server, no CDN).

```sh
npm install -g @sylad/cadence    # or: npx -p @sylad/cadence raf …

raf init                          # docs/plan/raf.yaml + post-commit hook
raf add "Monthly dedup on merge" --estimate 2
raf add "Typo in footer" --quickwin
raf add "Loan cache" --after L1
raf add "write the migration" --parent L1     # → L1/t1
raf start L1
git commit -m "feat(L1): dedup by calendar month"
raf now                           # in progress, next up (quickwins first), recently done
raf done L1/t1 && raf done L1
raf check                         # exit 1 on drift
raf gantt                         # docs/plan/gantt.html
```

### Commands

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `raf init [--project name] [--prefix L] [--no-hook]` | create the plan and install the hook |
| `raf add "title" [--estimate d] [--quickwin] [--visible] [--after L2,L4] [--parent L3]` | add a lot or a sub-task, print its id |
| `raf start <id>` · `raf done <id> [--force]` · `raf drop <id> [--reason text]` | dated transitions (`done` refuses open sub-tasks unless `--force`) |
| `raf note <id> "text"` | dated note — keep decisions next to the work |
| `raf now` | what to do next |
| `raf list [--status s]` | flat list |
| `raf check [--since date] [--idle 7]` | since the plan's adoption date by default: commits without a lot (commits touching only the plan are exempt), unknown ids, `todo` lots that already have commits, idle lots, `done` lots with open sub-tasks, bad or circular dependencies |
| `raf gantt [-o file]` | standalone Gantt page |
| `raf hook install` | add the (non-blocking, read-only) post-commit hook |

Global options: `--file path` or `RAF_FILE`; `RAF_TODAY=YYYY-MM-DD` to freeze
the date. `cadence raf …` is the same as `raf …`.

### Plan file

```yaml
version: 1
project: my-app
prefix: L
since: 2026-09-28     # commits before this date are not audited
ignore: ['^chore\(batch\):']   # optional: subjects of automated commits, neither audited nor counted for a lot
lots:
  - id: L1
    title: Monthly dedup on merge
    status: doing        # todo | doing | done | dropped
    estimate: 2          # working days
    quickwin: false
    visible: true        # user-facing: a news entry is expected when done
    after: [L0]
    created: 2026-09-28
    started: 2026-09-29
    notes:
      - { date: 2026-09-29, text: "keep the bank line when both sources exist" }
    tasks:
      - { id: t1, title: write the migration, status: done }
```

### A plan elsewhere, or in another format

`cadence.yaml`, at the repository root, can say where the plan is. The short form keeps raf's own
format, and the plan stays writable:

```yaml
plan: planning/todo.yaml
```

A project that already keeps its plan with its own tool is read **without migrating it**: describe
the file, and `raf now`, `raf list`, `raf check`, `raf gantt` and `cadence session start|close`
work on it. Such a plan is **read-only** — `raf add|start|done|note|ux` refuse and leave the file
to the project's tool.

```yaml
plan:
  path: docs/plan/taches.yaml
  project: my-app               # what the file does not say itself: project, since, ignore
  since: 2026-10-02
  ignore: ['^plan: ']
  files: [docs/plan/journal.ndjson]   # kept with the plan: a commit touching only these is a plan commit
  lots: taches                  # root key holding the list (default: lots)
  fields:                       # raf field: key in the file (a list = first one present)
    title: titre
    status: etat
    estimate: effort
    created: cree_le
    started: demarre_le
    finished: [livre_le, ferme_le]
    notes: note
    parent: parent
  statuses:                     # raf status: their states
    todo: [prevu, specifie]
    doing: [en_cours, teste]
    done: [deploye, valide]
    dropped: caduc
  estimates: { S: 0.5, M: 1, L: 3 }   # their effort labels, in working days
```

- Fields: `id`, `title`, `status`, `estimate`, `quickwin`, `visible`, `after`, `created`, `started`,
  `finished`, `notes`, `parent`; one left out is read under its own name. A timestamp counts for
  its day; a note written as plain text is one note.
- `parent`: an entry `B33/t1-fusion` whose parent is `B33` becomes the sub-task `t1-fusion` of `B33`.
- Ids need no prefix: a commit belongs to a lot when its message cites one of the plan's ids as a
  whole word (`E-A2`, `NC2.4`, `B33/t1-fusion`).
  An id that is not in the plan cannot be told from ordinary text: such a commit counts as
  "without a lot", never as an unknown reference.
- A state missing from `statuses`, or an effort label missing from `estimates`, is reported by
  `raf check`.

### Gantt scheduling

One lane of work. Finished lots use their real dates (or their commits' dates);
lots in progress run until `max(start + estimate, today)`; lots to do follow in
file order, after their dependencies, on working days.

## news

What changed *for the user*, one entry per visible lot, each with a screenshot.

- Mark a lot as user-facing with `raf add … --visible` (or `visible: true` in
  the YAML). `raf done` and the post-commit hook remind you to write its entry;
  `raf check` fails while a visible lot is done without one.
- An entry is a Markdown file in `docs/nouveautes/`, with a YAML header.
  Screenshots are files you take yourself, stored next to the entries.
- `cadence news build` writes `nouveautes.json` for your app to display, a
  self-contained `index.html`, and copies the screenshots.

```sh
raf add "Amounts like 3.000 read as three thousand" --visible   # → L8
raf start L8 && git commit -m "fix(L8): thousands separator" && raf done L8
cadence news new L8          # docs/nouveautes/2026-09-29-amounts-like-3-000-….md
# add docs/nouveautes/captures/l8.png, list it under `captures:`, write the text
cadence news check           # exit 1 on drift (also part of raf check)
cadence news build -o frontend/public/nouveautes
```

```markdown
---
title: Amounts like 3.000 read as three thousand
date: 2026-09-29
created: 2026-09-29T14:32+02:00
lots: [L8]
captures: [captures/l8.png]
# nocapture: reason, when a screenshot makes no sense
---
Imported statements now read **3.000** as three thousand, not three.
```

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `cadence news new <lot…> [--title t]` | entry skeleton, dated and timed now (`date`, `created`), titled after the lot |
| `cadence news list` | entries, newest first (see *Order* below) |
| `cadence news check` | visible lots done without entry, unknown lots, missing or undeclared screenshots, entries without creation time, bad headers |
| `cadence news stamp` | migration: writes `created:` into entries without one (or with an empty one), from the author date of the commit that added the file under its current name (now if not committed yet) |
| `cadence news build [-o dir]` | `nouveautes.json` + `index.html` + screenshots (default `docs/nouveautes/site`) |

`--dir` changes the entries folder (default `docs/nouveautes` at the git root).
The Markdown is deliberately small: paragraphs, `-` lists, `**bold**`,
`` `code` ``, `[links](url)`; everything else is escaped text. The JSON holds
`{ project, generated, entries: [{ slug, title, date, lots, captures, html }] }`,
with screenshot paths relative to the JSON file.

**Order.** Everywhere (`list`, `build`, the JSON), entries are strictly newest
first: by `date`, then, on the same day, by creation time. Every entry carries
it to the minute in its `created` header, which `cadence news new` writes as
local time with an explicit offset (`2026-09-29T14:32+02:00`, or `Z`). The
offset is required, so the order does not depend on the machine's time zone:
`news check` (and `raf check`) flags a value without it, an impossible one, an
empty `created:`, and an entry without `created`. `cadence news stamp` fills
it in older entries (or replaces an empty one) from the author date of the
commit that added the file under its current name; until then, that date is
used for sorting (an entry not committed yet counts as the newest). Renames
are not followed: a renamed entry counts as added on the day of the rename,
so stamp it before renaming it. The file name only breaks the remaining ties,
since it follows the title, not the chronology. The page and the JSON still
show the day only.

### UX review

```sh
raf ux enable                      # from today, a --visible lot needs a UX review before done
raf ux L4 "compliant after 2 fixes"   # record the verdict (from the ux-reviewer agent)
raf ux L8 "no screen: calculation fix"
```

With the rule on, `raf done` refuses a visible lot without a review (`--force`
to override) and `raf check` reports visible lots finished after the `uxSince`
day without one. Plans without `uxSince` are not affected.

## session

```sh
cadence session start              # notes from the last close, lots in progress (silent ones flagged),
                                   # work done since yesterday by lot, drift, repo state, 3 proposals
cadence session start --since "3 days ago" --idle 2
cadence session close              # today's commits by lot, commits without a lot, lots in progress
                                   # with no commit today, drift, uncommitted / unpushed work
                                   # exit 1 while something is still open
cadence session next "finish L3" "review L4"    # shown by the next session start
```

Proposals come from the plan only: lots in progress, then ready lots (dependencies
done), quick wins first. Local state lives in the git directory, never committed:
the close notes per worktree, the delivery lock and log in `.git/cadence/`, shared
by all the worktrees of a clone.

A project that already has its own morning and evening scripts keeps them: name
them in `cadence.yaml` and their output is added to the report, under "Faits
propres au projet", before the proposals (start) or the verdict (close).

```yaml
session:
  start: ./scripts/morning.sh "$CADENCE_SINCE"    # sh, at the repo root, 120 s at most
  close: ./scripts/evening.sh "$CADENCE_SINCE"
```

The commands get `CADENCE_SINCE` (the `--since` in effect) and `CADENCE_TODAY`. They
add facts and decide nothing: a failing command is reported and changes neither
the exit code nor the verdict.

## deliver

A delivery is done when its checks pass, not when a tool says "success".

```yaml
# cadence.yaml, at the repository root
deliver:
  ci: github              # github | none | { command: "…" }   (default: none)
  ciTimeout: 1800         # seconds
  deploy:                 # sh commands, in order, at the repo root
    - ./scripts/deploy.sh "$CADENCE_SHORT"
  verify:                 # at least one; retried every 10 s until verifyTimeout
    - url: https://app.example.com/api/health
      status: 200         # default 200
    - url: https://app.example.com/version.txt
      contains: "${SHORT}"
    - command: kubectl rollout status deploy/app --timeout=60s
  verifyTimeout: 300
  deployTimeout: 1800     # seconds, per deploy command
```

```sh
cadence deliver --dry-run    # preconditions, then the resolved steps; nothing runs
cadence deliver              # 0 delivered and verified · 1 a step failed · 2 refused before acting
```

- **Preconditions**: no modified tracked file; `HEAD` is on a remote branch (the
  CI can only build what was pushed); no other delivery running (a lock whose
  process died is removed with a warning); with `ci: github`, `gh` installed and
  logged in.
- Every command is killed when it exceeds its budget (CI, `deployTimeout`, what is
  left of `verifyTimeout`) and reported as "délai dépassé".
- **CI** `github`: polls `gh run list --commit <sha>` every 15 s; no run after
  5 minutes is a failure (you probably pushed another commit than the one you
  deliver); every run must end `success`, `skipped` or `neutral`. `gh` errors
  are retried, and reported with their cause after 5 minutes.
- Commands get `CADENCE_SHA`, `CADENCE_SHORT` (7 characters) and `CADENCE_BRANCH`;
  `${SHA}` and `${SHORT}` are replaced in `url` and `contains`.
- On success the lots cited by the commits since the previous delivery are
  listed, so you can `raf done` those whose effect you have seen.

### A project with its own delivery script

A project that already delivers with its own script (CI wait, deploy, business
checks) plugs it in instead of rewriting it as `ci` / `deploy` / `verify`:

```yaml
deliver:
  script: ./scripts/ship.sh "$CADENCE_SHORT"   # replaces ci and deploy
  allowDirty: true                             # optional: a modified tree is reported, not refused
  deployTimeout: 3600                          # seconds, for the whole script
  verify: []                                   # optional here: the script's own checks count
```

```sh
cadence deliver -- api frontend --news docs/changelog/x.md -- map    # everything after the first « -- » goes to the script
cadence deliver --dry-run -- api                                      # shows the full command, runs nothing
cadence deliver --sha 6b0d9aa -- api                                  # an earlier pushed commit instead of HEAD
```

`--sha` (any mode) delivers a pushed commit other than `HEAD` — for a CI that
builds each service only on the commit that touched it. `allowDirty` suits a
working tree shared by several sessions when the delivery starts from a pushed
sha and never from local files; without it a modified tree is refused.

cadence keeps what the script usually lacks: the preconditions (clean tree, pushed
`HEAD`), the lock (never two deliveries at once), the delivery log and the lots
delivered. Arguments are quoted for `sh`, so spaces and quotes reach the script
intact. If the script commits and pushes during the delivery (stamping a
changelog entry, say), the new `HEAD` is the sha recorded as delivered. Exit code
0 of the script means delivered; `verify` checks, if any, run after it.

## Claude Code skills

As a plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add Sylad/cadence
/plugin install cadence@cadence
```

gives `/cadence:session-start`, `/cadence:session-close`, `/cadence:deliver`,
`/cadence:lead` and the `ux-reviewer` agent. Or copy them into the repository with
`cadence skills install` (to `.claude/skills/cadence-*` and
`.claude/agents/cadence-ux-reviewer.md`; `--dir` for another `.claude` folder,
`--force` to overwrite local edits).

- **session-start**: reports the facts briefly, proposes three lots from the
  plan, then waits for your priority — nothing starts before your answer.
- **session-close**: plan hygiene, clean repository, memory limited to what the
  repository does not say, new skills or agents proposed but never created, three
  lines for next time.
- A project with its own tooling keeps it: its plan is read where it is (`plan:`),
  its delivery script is called by `cadence deliver` (`deliver.script`), its
  morning and evening scripts feed the session report (`session:`), and its own
  skills can become one-line aliases of `session-start` / `session-close`.
- **deliver**: dry run, delivery, and on failure the cause fixed rather than a
  blind retry.
- **lead**: from a folder holding several projects, one subagent per project
  gathers the facts, you choose the priorities, each lot is delegated to a
  subagent with a standard brief (test first, commits citing the lot, no push),
  reviewed, re-verified by the lead, then delivered one project at a time. Two
  subagents at most, never two in the same repository.
- **ux-reviewer** (agent): captures at 1440 and 390 px, findings grounded in a
  named rule (Nielsen, WCAG 2.2 AA) or a measurement, ranked, turned into
  `raf add --parent` sub-tasks, and a one-line verdict for `raf ux`. It never
  edits code.
