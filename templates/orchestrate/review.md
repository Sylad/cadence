Review lot `{{lot}}` — "{{titre}}" — of the repository `{{chemin}}`, following your agent instructions.
You are given the repository path and the lot id only: read the diff yourself from the commits that
cite the lot (`raf commits {{lot}}`, or `git log`), run the checks, report real defects only.
{{choix}}
You are read-only: do not modify, commit, push or run `raf review|ux|done`. Do not launch subagents.
Give your report as the structured output: counts of blocking / major / minor findings, each finding
(severity, file, line, text), proposed sub-tasks, what you could not verify, and the one-line verdict
for `raf review {{lot}}`.
